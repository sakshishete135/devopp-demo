1.git rebase -i
The -i flag is used to begin an interactive rebasing session. This provides all
the benefits of a normal rebase, but gives you the opportunity to add, edit, or
delete commits along the way.

2.git reflog
Git keeps track of updates to the tip of branches using a mechanism called 
reflog. This allows you to go back to changesets even though they are not 
referenced by any branch or tag.

3.git remote
A convenient tool for administering remote connections. Instead of passing the 
full URL to the fetch, pull, and push commands, it lets you use a more 
meaningful shortcut.

4.git reset
Undoes changes to files in the working directory. Resetting lets you clean up
or completely remove changes that have not been pushed to a public repository.

5.git revert
Undoes a committed snapshot. When you discover a faulty commit, reverting is a 
safe and easy way to completely remove it from the code base.
