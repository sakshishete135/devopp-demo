1. git add
Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. This gives you the 
opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history.

2.git branch
This command is your general-purpose branch administration tool. It lets you create
isolated development environments within a single repository.

3.git checkout
In addition to checking out old commits and old file revisions, git checkout is also
the means to navigate existing branches. Combined with the basic Git commands,
itâ€™s a way to work on a particular line of development.

4.git clean
Removes untracked files from the working directory. This is the logical counterpart
to git reset, which (typically) only operates on tracked files.

5.git clone
Creates a copy of an existing Git repository. Cloning is the most common way for 
developers to obtain a working copy of a central repository.
