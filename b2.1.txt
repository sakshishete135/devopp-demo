1.git commit
Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. Combined with 
git add, this defines the basic workflow for all Git users.

2.git commit --amend
Passing the --amend flag to git commit lets you amend the most recent commit. 
This is very useful when you forget to stage a file or omit important 
information from the commit message.

3.git config
A convenient way to set configuration options for your Git installation. 
Youâ€™ll typically only need to use this immediately after installing Git on a 
new development machine.

4.git fetch
Fetching downloads a branch from another repository, along with all of its 
associated commits and files. But, it doesn't try to integrate anything into 
your local repository. This gives you a chance to inspect changes before 
merging them with your project.

5.git init
Initializes a new Git repository. If you want to place a project under revision
control, this is the first command you need to learn.
