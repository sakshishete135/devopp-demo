1. --soft
Does not touch the index file or the working tree at all (but resets the head to
 <commit>, just like all modes do). This leaves all your changed files
 "Changes to be committed", as git status would put it.

2. --mixed
Resets the index but not the working tree (i.e., the changed files are preserved
but not marked for commit) and reports what has not been updated.
This is the default action.

If -N is specified, removed paths are marked as intent-to-add (see git-add[1]).

3. --hard
Resets the index and working tree. Any changes to tracked files in the working
tree since <commit> are discarded. Any untracked files or directories in the way
of writing any tracked files are simply deleted.

4. --merge
Resets the index and updates the files in the working tree that are different 
between <commit> and HEAD, but keeps those which are different between the index
and working tree (i.e. which have changes which have not been added). 
If a file that is different between <commit> and the index has unstaged changes, 
reset is aborted.
