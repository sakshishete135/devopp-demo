1.git log
Lets you explore the previous revisions of a project. It provides several
formatting options for displaying committed snapshots.

2.git merge
A powerful way to integrate changes from divergent branches. After forking the 
project history with git branch, git merge lets you put it back together again.

3.git pull
Pulling is the automated version of git fetch. It downloads a branch from a 
remote repository, then immediately merges it into the current branch. This is 
the Git equivalent of svn update.

4.git push
Pushing is the opposite of fetching (with a few caveats). It lets you move a 
local branch to another repository, which serves as a convenient way to publish
contributions. This is like svn commit, but it sends a series of commits 
instead of a single changeset.

5.git rebase
Rebasing lets you move branches around, which helps you avoid unnecessary merge
commits. The resulting linear history is often much easier to understand and 
explore.
